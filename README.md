[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. These [problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) build on each other and tackle a wide range of [topics](http://rosalind.info/problems/topics/), some of which are listed below.

- Alignment
- Combinatorics
- Dynmaic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Genome Assembly
- Genome Rearrangements
- Population Dynamics

This repository is divided into three directories: [problems](./problems) which houses each problem, [datasets](./datasets) which houses the downloaded datasets from Rosalind necessary for completing each problem, and [answers](./answers) which houses the solution to the respective dataset for each problem. Files are named for the unique ID attributed to each problem by Rosalind.
