# Rosalind Python Solutions

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. These [problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) build on each other and tackle a wide range of [topics](http://rosalind.info/problems/topics/).

This repository is divided into three directories: 
- [problems](./problems) which houses each problem
- [datasets](./datasets) which houses one possible dataset, downloaded from Rosalind, necessary for completing each problem
- [answers](./answers) which houses the solution to the respective dataset for each problem
