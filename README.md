# Rosalind Python Solutions

This repository houses my solutions for the problems in the Rosalind platform. It showcases my coding, data structures, algorithms, and unit testing skills.

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. These [problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) build on each other and tackle a wide range of [topics](http://rosalind.info/problems/topics/).

This repository is divided into three directories:

- [problem_solutions](./problem_solutions) contains my solutions for each problem
- [datasets](./datasets) contains a dataset, downloaded from Rosalind, necessary for completing each problem
- [answers](./answers) contains the solution to the respective dataset for each problem
